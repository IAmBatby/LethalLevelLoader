* All Vanilla content has been manually assigned Content Tags to allow developers to reference vanilla content via tags the same way they would custom content, You can find those tags here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WO77KGJplIEC64qmBClOgfEEoFxrhMurCEqe9FKod8I/edit?usp=sharing

**<details><summary>Version 1.1.0</summary>**

**<details><summary>Features</summary>**

<details><summary>Terminal >preview Keyword</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now has a new feature added to the Terminal which allows users to change what information is previewed adjacent to each Moon listed in the `MoonsCatalogue`. This can be toggled via the `preview` verb keyword followed by one of the following options. (LethalLevelLoader also includes a configuration option to set which information type is used by default.)*

* * `preview weather`
* * `preview difficulty`
* * `preview history`
* * `preview all`
* * `preview none`
* * `preview vanilla`
</details>


<details><summary>Terminal >sort Keyword</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now has a new feature added to the Terminal which allows users to decide how Moons are sorted when listed in the `MoonsCatalogue`. This can be toggled via the `sort` verb keyword followed by one of the following options. (LethalLevelLoader also includes a configuration option to set which sorting type is used by default.)*

* * `sort price`
* * `sort difficulty`
* * `sort tag`
* * `sort quota`
* * `sort run`
* * `sort none`
</details>

<details><summary>Terminal >filter Keyword</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now has a new feature added to the Terminal which allows users to decide which Moons are listed in the `MoonsCatalogue`. This can be toggled via the `filter` verb keyword followed by one of the following options. (LethalLevelLoader also includes a configuration option to set which filtering type is used by default.)*

* * `filter price`
* * `filter weather`
* * `filter tag`
* * `filter last travelled`
* * `filter none`
</details>

<details><summary>Terminal >simulate Keyword</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now has a new feature added to the Terminal which allows users to "Simulate" landing on a Moon. This provides a presentable, lore friendly way to view the possible `DungeonFlow` choices with accurate rarity via the Terminal. To use this feature, use `simulate` and a Moon's name, the same way you would use `route`. LethalLevelLoader now includes a configuration option to switch between viewing the `DungeonFlow`'s rarity via raw value or calculated percentage.*
</details>

<details><summary>LevelHistory</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now has an experimental `LevelHistory` feature that stores notable information regarding each day in the current save. This includes information such as the Level, DungeonFlow, Weather and more. This feature allows modders and future updates to LethalLevelLoader to create mechanics and systems dependant on the history of the current play session.*
</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedDungeonFlow: Host Decides DungeonFlow & DungeonSize</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now modifies the way Lethal Company selects the random `DungeonFlow` and it's dungeon size so only the Host client selects these values which is then sent to the remaining non host clients. This is to help prevent game-breaking dungeon desync when players have mismatching dungeon configuration settings.*
</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedDungeonFlow: Dynamic Weather Rarity Injection</summary>
* *ExtendedDungeonFlow's now contain a `StringWithRarity` list which allows dungeon developers to dynamically inject their dungeon into the current `SelectableLevel`'s possible `DungeonFlow` options.*
</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedDungeonFlow: GlobalProp Dynamic Scaling</summary>
* *ExtendedDungeonFlow's now contain a `GlobalPropCountOverride` list which allows dungeon developers to dynamically increase or increase a `GlobalProp`'s minimum and maximum values based on the currently used dungeon size.*
</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedLevel: MoonCataloguePages & ExtendedLevelGroups</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now completely overhauls how the `MoonsCatalogue` TerminalNode functions internally. `ExtendedLevel`'s are now stored in groups via a class named `ExtendedLevelGroup`, These `ExtendedLevelGroup`'s are then stored in groups via a class named `MoonsCataloguePage`. This overhaul allows other mods and future updates to LethalLevelLoader to control and store `ExtendedLevel`s in many ways that were previously limited.*
</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedLevel: Lock Route</summary>
* *ExtendedLevel's now contain a `isLocked` bool and `lockedNodeText` string that controls whether the Level can currently be routed to via the Terminal. When locked the Terminal will display the `lockedNodeText` string as failed routing response on the Terminal (Or a generic response if the string is left empty)*
</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedLevel: Hide Level</summary>
* *ExtendedLevel's now contain a `isHidden` bool that controls whether the Level is displayed in the >Moons Terminal page*
</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedLevel: New Story Log Support</summary>
* *ExtendedLevel's can now add their own custom Story Log's, Without the need of custom code. ExtendedLevel's now contain a `List<StoryLogData>` that takes in a level-dependent `storyLogID` int, a `terminalWord`string, a `storyLogTitle` string and a `storyLogDescription` string.*
</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedLevel: Provide Level Info Description</summary>
* *By default ExtendedLevel's have their >info display text generated using their `SelectableLevel.LevelDescription` string, ExtendedLevel's now have an optional `infoNodeDescription` string if they wish to write their text manually.*
