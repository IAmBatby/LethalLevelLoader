**Description**

### **1.2.0 for Lethal Company v50 Has Released!**

**LethalLevelLoader** is a custom API to support the manual and dynamic integration of custom levels and dungeons in Lethal Company. 
Mod Developers can provide LethalLevelLoader with their custom content via code or via automatic assetbundle detection, From there LethalLevelLoader will seamlessly load it into the game.

This Mod is Likely To Be Incompataible with **LethalExpansion**, Due To The inherit conflicts involved in changing the same systems.
